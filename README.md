# Pomodoro Timer
A pomodoro timer is a type of study/work timer where you do something for 25 minutes, then take a break for 5 minutes. This project is meant to make a small but useful pomodoro timer with HTML, CSS, and JS.

### Requirements 
- A timer
- A button that starts the work timer (25 min) and break timer (5 min)
- A special sound that is made when the timer is finished, it'll be different depending on wether it's the work or break timer

### Additions
- A progress bar that shows when the timer will end
- A clock dropdown showing the time, and when clicked will calculate what time it'll be when a pomodoro (and/or a series of pomodoros) end
- A setting where you can change the theme, amount in the break and work time, and/or a checkbox to make the timers automatically start when one ends
- Multiple themes of different colors and fonts, including a dark mode.

Use Tutorials and guides to learn how to use something for the project, not the project itself. Happy coding!
